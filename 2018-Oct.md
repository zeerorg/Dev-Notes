1. React Rendering of Components - (20th):
   * I thought react rendered components by initializing them, but if the parent component passes new props then the component isn’t re rendered. I.e, it will retain its state.
   * To trigger re render you pass a “key” prop to the component, if the key is same then component is not re rendered
   * There are other ways like using lifecycle method “getDerivedStateFromProps”.
   * Tags: react router components web javascript
2. CMAKE, c++ project management
   * There needs to be a CMakeLists.txt file in the folder.
   * Main commands:
     * Add_executable: To create a new executable or exe.
     * Add_library: To create a new library for use with other libraries or executables.
     * Target_link_libraries: To link any library or executable you are building with any other library or executable
     * Include_directories: To add directories for fetching “header files”
     * Add_subdirectory: To add subdirectory to the project. That subdirectory should contain a “CMakeLists.txt” file. Also, subdirectories can share their variables.
     * Add_custom_target: To add a new command to make, this way you can run any executable.
   * Structuring my cmake project
   * CMake Testing
   * CMake version should be as low as possible: (3.0 should work) since package managers have cmake version low
   * Add_test: to add an executable as a test.
3. .Net versioning
   * .net standard is the base framework over which all .net is based.
   * Any library hence should be pointed to .net standard to be compatible with every .net thing (framework, core etc.)
   * Current .net standard version = 2

4. Character encoding error in react. Don’t know why it occurred, but it is solved by setting charset encoding to utf-8 (duh. This fucking occurred again).
   * `<meta charset=”utf-8”>`
   * `<script charset=”utf-8” type=”text/javascript”>`
   * Found the problem: I was linking the page with “a” tag instead of react router’s “Link”, I mean wtf.
   
5. Ethereum development
   * Use go don’t use any other language. Just don’t. Starting point: https://hackernoon.com/a-step-by-step-guide-to-testing-and-deploying-ethereum-smart-contracts-in-go-9fc34b178d78
   * You need to have gcc installed for it to work
   * Look on your major project for more info
   * Important pdf: https://goethereumbook.org/ethereum-development-with-go.pdf

6. Non-blocking socket read. Using Select() to monitor if any file descriptor has changed. This can be used instead of “recv” which blocks till you get something.
   * Select() is given a list of file descriptors (can be sockets) and then we it waits and returns a single file descriptor that can be read without blocking.
7. Non-Blocking read and write using “NON_BLOCK” flag. This flag will tell that the reads should not block. This can be used instead of select(), but it creates a “busy” wait cycle where cpu is constantly looping till there is something to read, whereas select() is a lot more straight forward.
8. Go modules (tags: go mod tidy packages golang):
   * It is a new way to manage go modules with a project.
   * You don’t need to put the go project into go path.
   * Start by making a go module “go mod init github.com/zeerorg/some_project” inside root directory of the project.
   * Write some code, then run “go mod tidy”, this will add dependencies used in the project on the “go.mod” file and “go.sum” file
   * Build and test as usual by doing “go build” or “go test” and everything should work fine.
   * In subpackages, the

9. React Component vs Element vs Instances vs StatelessComponents (SFC)
   * React Component is a class that has code to render and do something. It is what we write.
   * Instance is an object of the class, this does not have much use in the context of react since it shouldn’t be directly used or referenced in the code.
   * React Element on the other hand is something that is rendered on the screen by react. It is initialized by JSX code: `<Component />`
   * StatelessComponents are like React Component but without any state and are defined as functions. Hence, SFC do no create any Instances.
   * Whenever an SFC is called it creates a React Element.
   * React Elements are building blocks of the rendered page. Whenever the “render” method is called it returns React Elements.
   * Distinguishing between these is important when writing HOC or Render Props.
   * Higher Order Components (HOC) take one or more “Components” and return a “Component”
   * Render props take a function “children” or “render”. The function takes an object and returns an “Element”
7. Testing React components using react-testing-library. (tags react testing unit tests jsx)
   * React-testing-library is simplest way to test react components
   * It is a collection of useful functions on top of jest testing framework
   * “Render” and “simulate” are functions imported from “react-testing-library”
   * “render” takes an element and provides with HTML DOM nodes and some functions to query
   * “container” is the topmost rendered HTMLDOM node and can be used with “querySelector” to get specific node
   * “getByText” can be used to search a component which has a specific text inside it.
   * Mocking:
     * Using fetch mocks, set global.fetch to fetch imported from “jest-fetch-mock”
