1. Single node kubernetes cluster
   * For windows, kubernetes and kubectl come preinstalled. You’ll need to start the cluster from docker for desktop application.
   * For linux, install microk8s from snap store
   * There is also [minikube](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/), but getting it working on windows with hyper-v is a big pain in the ass
   * You can use [KinD (Kubernetes in Docker)](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind)
     * How to Use: Go into WSL bash (doesn't work with windows powershell yet!) 
     * `go get -u sigs.k8s.io/kind`
     * `kind create cluster`
2. Difference between different unix-like shit for windows
   * MingW: Minimalist GNU for Windows
     * It provides Unix-like environment for windows. It does not provide compilers or anything to compile software for windows, instead it is meant to provide unix tools.
     * Example: make tool is available, gcc is available but it does not have “socket” functionality
     * It is an alternative to Microsoft visual C compiler.
     * Mingw doesn’t ship any binary of its own, it uses windows environment
   * Cygwin: 
     * It is a UNIX environment for windows
     * It is aimed at providing the unix environment and all the tools (like socket) for windows.
     * Any C program written in linux should compile for windows using Cygwin
     * This is free, but its license is restrictive
     * It ships with its own dll, which provides interoperability
3. VSCode tasks and launch.json
   * Tasks are run, build, test
   * Launch.json is for opening debugging
4. Flexbox usage css web development frontend
