   * For linux, install microk8s from snap store
2. Difference between different unix-like shit for windows
   * MingW: Minimalist GNU for Windows
     * It provides Unix-like environment for windows. It does not provide compilers or anything to compile software for windows, instead it is meant to provide unix tools.
     * Example: make tool is available, gcc is available but it does not have “socket” functionality
     * It is an alternative to Microsoft visual C compiler.
     * Mingw doesn’t ship any binary of its own, it uses windows environment
   * Cygwin: 
     * It is a UNIX environment for windows
     * It is aimed at providing the unix environment and all the tools (like socket) for windows.
     * Any C program written in linux should compile for windows using Cygwin
     * This is free, but its license is restrictive
     * It ships with its own dll, which provides interoperability
