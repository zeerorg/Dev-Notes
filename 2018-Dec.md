# December 2018
1. React app development environment REACT_APP NODE_ENV check if development or production
   * The “process.env.NODE_ENV” variable is set to “development” when running in development environment.
2. C# XML and LINQ
   * Use https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.servicemodel.syndication?view=netframework-4.7.2
   * System.servicemodel.syndication for creating RSS feeds.
3. Openfaas setup
   * Docker should be present, this means there will be docker swarm also (which is required)
   * Install faas-cli : `curl -sL https://cli.openfaas.com | sudo sh`
   * Initialize docker swarm with: `docker swarm init`
   * Deploy stack
     * for linux 64bit: `git clone https://github.com/openfaas/faas &&  cd faas && ./deploy_stack.sh`
     * for rPi armhf: `git clone https://github.com/openfaas/faas && cd faas && ./deploy_stack.armhf.sh`
   * Login to faas-cli with the command shown
   * `~/.openfaas/config.yml` contains the login information, the `token` property needs to be base64 decoded into username and password
   
4. Creating Openfaas function
   * Openfaas functions are created from templates
   * Pull templates using: faas-cli template pull `https://github.com/zeerorg/templates`
   * Templates need to be present in the same folder. (could be improved)
   * Creating a function: `faas-cli new function_name --lang {template_name}`
   * Go into the `function_name` folder where you can edit files to deploy them
   * Inside the `function_name.yml` there are variables that can be tweeked.

5. Creating Openfaas template
   * Every template has 2 parts: Dockerfile, function directory
   * The docker file contains the definition of a container that starts the watchdog service and defines necessary environment variables
   * The function directory contains the sample function, this function directory is copied to create a new function and the function edits the files inside directory.
   * Take examples from “https://github.com/zeerorg/templates” to write new templates
   
6. Portainer Installation
   * `docker run -d -p 9000:9000 -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock -v portainer_data:/data portainer/portainer`
   
7. Ngrok windows server http asp net .net core
   * If bad request is there then host-header needs to change
   * `ngrok http {port} -host-header="localhost:{port}"`

8. Asp .net server visual studio error : `Unable to start IIS Server`
   * This is due to ports and shit
   * Close visual studio then, Delete `.vs/config/applicationsettings.json` file, then open visual studio
   
9. Docker Dockerfile (tags: creating dockerfile container new)
   * Add new user to docker container: 
     * `RUN useradd -ms /bin/bash newuser`
     * Creates user and their directory, sets bash as default shell
   * Tini (tags: process docker)
     * It is init for docker processes to prevent zombie processes
     * Refer https://github.com/krallin/tini 
   * Ubuntu Debian docker images
     * `ENV DEBIAN_FRONTEND noninteractive`
     * This sets the environment to non-interactive so that there are no prompts
     * Use “apt-get” over “apt” for installing packages
     * Use “apt-get clean” to remove cached packages
   * Search for arm images in https://hub.docker.com/u/arm32v7/
